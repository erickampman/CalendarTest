#  CalendarTest

This multiplatform app adds, updates, and removes calendar events. I've tested it on a mac (Sequoia) and an iphone (18.0.1). 
I was unsuccessful in getting this to work properly when the target was macOS, but Mac Catalyst works ok. 

It's just demo code so there are many rough edges. 

The following doesn't get displayed on an iphone, so is quoted here:

- Click on the Calender/Plus icon to add to the calendar.
- Click on the activity name to edit. If you save the activity it will automatically be added to the calendar.
- Click on the '+' button to add a new activity.
- Click on the garbage can to delete an activity. This will also delete the item from the calendar. 
	- on iPhone the left-slide gesture works too.
